There are a few ways to install Python in Mac. 

1. Install system-wide via the official Python installation package.

2. Install a Anaconda Python distribution locally.

3. Install locally using Homebrew.

A few comments about different ways of installation.

1. Anaconda and Homebrew installs Python locally rather than system-wide.
    You have to install Python using an official installation package manually
    if you need a system-wide installation.

2. There are limited choices of Python versions in Homebrew.
    Go with Anaconda Python if you cannot find the version you need in Homebrew.
