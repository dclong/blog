I have heard about this LaTeX IDE for a long time. I
tried it today on a Debian virtual machine. It works like a charm. I like the preview
function a lot. Using inline preview, you can see compiled result while you are
typing. It works even with user-defined commands. 
This is very helpful for people who has to use massive math expression in
LaTeX, which make TeXstudio comparable to the WYSIWYG LaTeX IDE "LyX". The
advatantage of TeXstudio over Lyx is obvious. You write pure LaTeX code. You
do not have to remember many shortcuts and commands specific to LyX. TeXstudio has
tons of other features such as auto-complete, highlighting, structure view, reversing
search and so on. It is also cross platform! TeXstudio has the potential to be
the terminator of debate on LaTeX IDEs.
