1. Click the Edit meu.

2. Select "Dictionaries...".

3. In the pop-up, choose the "Source" tab,
    and then click on the "Websites" tab below.

4. Click the "Add..." button on the right to add a dictioanry website.
    You have to use `%GDWORD%` to replace the actual word to be queried.
    For example, 
    when you query the word "pervert" on iCIBA,
    the returned query URL is <www.iciba.com/pervert>.
    So you have to use the address <www.iciba.com/%GDWORD%> 
    if you want to add the iCIBA website to GoldenDict.
