Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers
but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.

1. [cloud9-docker](https://store.docker.com/community/images/kdelfour/cloud9-docker)
is a good docker image for cloud9 IDE.
You are able to attach a local directory as the workspace 
so that you do not have to create (private) workspaces on cloud9.

2. [ensime-cloud9](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-cloud9)
is a plugin for Scala support in cloud9 IDE.

3. Java/Scala support is not ready at this time.
