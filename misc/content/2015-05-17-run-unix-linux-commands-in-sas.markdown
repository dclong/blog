fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.

SAS can run Unix/Linux commands everywhere using
```SAS
x command;
```
For exampel,
to create a directory named "abc" in your home directory.
```SAS
x mkdir ~/abc;
```

It can even run user-defined shell scripts, 
which is great. 
even though you can use unix/linux command in sas, 
it seems that it is not robust and it is often hard 
to test whether the command has run successfully.
It is suggested that you avoid using unix/linux commands in sas.
