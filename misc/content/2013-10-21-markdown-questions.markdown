1. how to define a link variable in jekyll or in markdown?

2. does markdown support include and so on? if there are mutiple md file in a folder, several of them are use by a main file. what happens? can we tell jekyll not to compile some of the markdown files?	

3. markdown small size? right aliganment?	

4. categories, hierarchical? ...? it seems that jekyll support both	

5. can we include a pdf in jekyll? I guess the problem is that whether html can do that

6. how to add a title for a figure?

1. The list environment does not work as expected sometimes. 
Why does this happen? 
Do we have to add two extra spaces so that it works?
The list environment problem might actually the problem of firefox. 
It seems that Chrome displays pages correctly.


2. It seems that the comment separate one paragraph into two. 

3. how to indent list?
