## Scroll in Tmux

1. ctrl + b z: zoom/maximize

2. ctrl + b + o: switch to the next panel

3. Ctrl-b then [ then you can use your normal navigation keys to scroll around (eg. Up Arrow or PgDn). 
Press q to quit scroll mode.

Alternatively you can press Ctrl-b PgUp to go directly into copy mode 
and scroll one page up (which is what it sounds like you will want most of the time)

You can also scroll up/down line by line using Shift-k 
and Shift-j (if you're already in scroll mode).
