1. do we even have to worry about clearing variables in vbscript? I somehow have the impression that VB-like language support garbage collection

2. VBScript rules? set and dim? it seems that for some object you must use set, e.g., Scripting.FileSystemObject and Excel.Application

3. can we source in VBScript like bash script?
