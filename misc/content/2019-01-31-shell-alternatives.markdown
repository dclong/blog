## [IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython)

IPython is the best and simpliest Python approach to replace shell so far.

## [xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh)

Another Python approach to replace shell. 
It looks interesting and quite promising too.

## [plumbum](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/plumbum)

Yet another Python approach as a replacement of shell. 
I personally prefer IPython and xonsh to plumbum.
