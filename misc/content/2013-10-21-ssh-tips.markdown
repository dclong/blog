3. when use sshfs and fuse, you want to add your user account into the fuse group,

        gpasswd -a dclong fuse
        newgrp fuse

4. best to set no password for public keys,
    though it's not very secure,
    it saves lots of potential problems, such as keyring management,
    ssh key for cron and so on

5. must use no passphrase for ssh so that ssh works

make sure to set `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to be true (follow the steps below).

1. Open an empty tab in Firefox.

2. Go to about:config in the URL bar.

3. Search for `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns`.

4. Change the value to be `true`.
