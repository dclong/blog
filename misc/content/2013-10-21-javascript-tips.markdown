## Node.js

[Node.js](https:/nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime environment outside browsers.

1. case sensitive

2. you don't have to write every line of code in HTML,
you can save JavaScript code in another file and then load it.


3. alert vs confirm vs prompt

An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.

A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.

When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.

If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.

A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.

If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.

[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects. 
It's the answer to the question: 
"If I sit down in front of a blank HTML page, 
and want to start being productive immediately, 
what do I need?" ... and the tie to go along with jQuery's tux and Backbone's suspenders.
