The wiki page
[Android Emulators](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Android_emulators)
has a good summary of popular Android emulators.
Most of the Android emulators are based on VirtualBox and for Windows only.
[GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)
is a great cross-platform choice but unfortunately non-free.
[BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) is a good free Android emulator for Windows and Mac.
[LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/) (also called 雷电模拟器 in Chinese) is a good free Android emulator for Windows only.
Besides GenyMotion which is non-free,
there is no other good Android emulator for Linux.
AnBox is an open-source WINE-like Android emulator for Linux,
but unfortunately it cannot run ARM-only apps on a x86-based Linux OS.
