1. the connection via ssh to my toshiba is very unstable, I'm not sure what have cuased the problem? 
The internet seems OK, or maybe it is because I'm copying larges files over local network 

2. ssh-copy-id doesn't work?

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: ssh: Could not resolve hostname y570.stat.iastate.edu -p 323: Name or service not known

3. SSH: ‘No Route to Host’ error
