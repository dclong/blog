    hadoop fs -cat
    hadoop fs -mkdir [-p] /path/to/create


2. Upload a file/directory to HDFS.

        hadoop fs -put [-f]

    The option `-f` overwrite existing files on HDFS. 
    However, 
    a tricky misunderstanding might happend when you upload a directory using the following command.

        hadoop fs -put -f /local/path/to/some_directory /hdfs/path/to/some_directory

    Supppose `/hdfs/path/to/some_directory` already exists,
    it is not the directory `/hdfs/path/to/some_directory` itself get overwritten 
    but rather files in it get overwritten.
    If files in `/local/path/to/some_directory` have diffrent names than files in `/hdfs/path/to/some_directory`
    then nothing is overwritten.
    This might not what you want and can get you bitten. 
    It is suggested that you always remove a directory manually using the command `hdfs dfs -rm -r /hdfs/path/to/some_directory`
    if you intend to overwrite the whole directory.

    hadoop fs -get
    hadoop fs -getmerge /hdfs/path /path/in/linux
    hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /path/in/linux /hdfs/path
    hadoop fs -put /path/in/linux /hdfs/path

## Move/Rename Files/Directories

Move/rename the source file/directory `/path/to/source` TO `/path/to/des`.

    :::bash
    hdfs dfs -mv /path/to/source /path/to/des

Move the source file/directory `/path/to/source` INTO the directory `/path/to/des`.
That is,
move/rename the file/directory `/path/to/source` to `/path/to/des/source`.

    :::bash
    hdfs dfs -mv /path/to/source /path/to/des/

## Tail

    hadoop fs -tail /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt

## Copy Files/Directories

    hadoop fs -cp /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt /user/saurzcode/dir2

2. The command `hdfs dfs -mkdir` supports the `-p` option similar to that of the `mkdir` command in Linux/Unix.

3. Check size of a directory.
    However, the depth option is not supported currently.

        hdfs dfs -du [-s] [-h] URI [URI â€¦] 

4. Remove a directory in HDFS without making a backup in trash.
    This is a dangerous operation 
    but it is useful when the directory that you want to remove 
    is too big to place into the trash directory.

        hadoop fs -rm -r -skipTrash /tmp/chdu_item_desc

## Parquet Format

Hadoop commands do not support merging Parquet files. 
You can use [apache/parquet-mr](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr) to merge Parquet files.

1. no update, have to update locally and upload to hadoop

3. by default 3 reps of each block of data, 3 reps is the best according to many discussions

4. hadoop is for large data of course

5. because of false tolorence/replication of data, you acutally use more space on Hadoop

6. master node (name node): data about data, primary and secondary master node, for reliable

7. data nodes (slave nodes), edge node, access point for the external applications, tools, and users that need to utilize the hadoop environment

11. edge nodes (gate to hadoop), name nodes, data nodes
