1. Is there a good way to maps keys in windows?

2. Win 7 freezes at "starting windows" after boot and freezes at "Setup windows" if reinstall.
What caused this problem? 
And can you solve it?
I found some post (see email) saying tht modifying settings in BIOS might solve this problem. 
And some people say it might due to problem of grub, however, the Linux (Debian) boot fine.
