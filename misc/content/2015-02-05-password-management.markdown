1. keepassx is great on Linux but not as great on Windows and Mac. 
Keepass is great on Windows and there format are compatiable (kdb and kdbx), 
so it is suggest that you use keepassx on linux but keepass on windows

1. keepassX, favorate items, tags, etc
	a. user-defined white spaces is handy
2. keepassx favorate, most frequently used? or others that support this feature?
	you either have to do this by yourself or ask people to add this feature
	
3. use AutoKey to help you
don't put the entire password there, just use a partial or or superset one
or use multiple phrases to help you



KeePassDroid : 
teamdrive: slide left a little bit, middle button -> open in minikeepass

MiniKeePass

it seems that multi-screen makes keepassx auto enter not work well
