## Frameworks

### UI Friendly Frameworks

H2O

### Big-data (Spark) Friendly Frameworks

## [AutoML](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/automl-tips/)


## Questions

### Random Forest

1. Is discrete variables easier to handle than continous variables (in random forest)?
    Is there any advantage of discretize variables?
    The eseential question is how is categorical varialbes handled in RF?
    Does RF use category variables directly or does it have to convert it to numerical somehow?

2. Random forest has a way to impute missing values.
    What if I treat missing values in categorical predictors and a new class?
    It sounds like a good ...

## Imputation

1. mean, median, etc.

1. SVD imputation using low dimension to approximate high dimension data
