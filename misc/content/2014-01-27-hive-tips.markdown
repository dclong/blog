**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. It is not meant to readers but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.**
 

0. Hive is case-insensitive, both keywords and functions

1. You can use both double and single quotes for strings

1. use `=` rather than `==` for equality comparison
but it seems that `==` also works

2. use `%` rather than `*` for matching multiple characters

3. use quit or exit

4. when filtering use the where clause
while when joining use the on clause

5. it seems that it's not necessary to use group before running aggregation functions
in hive, e.g., when you count the number of records in a table.

6. must separate fields/column names with comma in the select clause or group by clause.

7. it seems to me that Hive runs command from right to left?


## Common Mistakes

1. Forget to separate fields with comma in the select or group by clause.
