It works across operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux).
Android X86 supports provides ISO and RPM files
rather than an out-of-the-box application.
You have to install an ISO or RPM file to you device 
which will add an Android operating system to your device.
You can of course install it into a virutal environemnt (e.g., using VirtualBox)
which is essentially what other out-of-the-box applications does.

## [BlissOS](https://blissos.org/) + VirtualBox
Similar to Android X86 + VirtualBox.

## Android SDK + Android Studio

Android SDK and Android Studio works together to emulate software found on Android 
using the resources of your PC. 
Android developers mostly use Android SDK tools for testing and development purposes, 
but it'll work for casual use and play as well.
