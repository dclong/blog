Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. 
Please read with your own judgement!

1. Do not use `email+extra@gmail.com`. 
This only makes things more complicated.
Of course, 
it makes your accounts securer.
Do not use it to subscribe emails!!!

2. Not a good idea to subscribe to mail list with lots of active discussions.
Directly read the discussions on website is a better alternative

3. Avoid receiving useless emails. 
Just unsubscribe emails that you never read.
