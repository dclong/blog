1. use tor

1. Use PrivateInternetAccess (or similar VPN tools) to protect your privacy.
    Unfortuantely PrivateInternetAccess is block in China.

2. It is recommended that you use a virtual machine or Docker to download files using PIA.
    The advantage is that only the virtual machine's ip is map to a different one,
    ip sensitive tools such as ssh can still be used on you computer
