1. Apache Airflow is the recommended tool for managing workflows current!
    A big advantage of Airflow over other workflow managing tools (e.g., UC4)
    is that the workflow is expressed in (simple and concise) Python code. 
    It is easy to version control and review changes in source code 
    while it is extremly hard to do so for graphically expressed workflows,
    especially when the workflow grows large.
