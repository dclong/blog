## Bokeh Server

very convenient, but batch rather than interactive mode

## Jupyter/JupyterLab Dashboard

JupyterLab plans to support dashboard. 

Currently, you can use the Jupyter Dashboard.

[Jupyer Dashboard Docker Deploy](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/dashboards_setup/tree/master/docker_deploy)

## HVF/franchise

## [Bowtie](https://github.com/jwkvam/bowtie)

another good dashboard candidate ...

## Superset

Superset is great! 
But it seems that it is for SQL only? 
Is python scripting supported?
based on python, but doesn't support direct python scraping ...

## Plotly Dash

Great but unfortunately plotly is not totally free (very limited API calls).

## Redash

Redash sounds like a good one, but still missing a few components:

1. Teradata SQL support
2. python pandas support
