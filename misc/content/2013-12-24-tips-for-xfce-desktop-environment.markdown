It is not meant to readers but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.

1. broken symbolic .bashrc stops Xfce from login to GUI
I guess this is a common problem

## Shortcuts

1. Set a shorcut for Xfce App Finder which is frequently used.

2. Set a shortcut for terminator.


## Sessions 

I don't use this functionality at all. I disable auto save session functionality.

## Touchpad

1. disable tap while typing

2. enable touchpad 

## Must Have Plugins 

1. Make sure you have both Notification Area and Indicator Plugin on your panel.
