## Libraries

### auto-sklearn

### [autogluon](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon)

AutoGluon automates machine learning tasks enabling you 
to easily achieve strong predictive performance in your applications. 
With just a few lines of code, 
you can train and deploy high-accuracy deep learning models on tabular, image, and text data.

### [turicreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate)

Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. 
You don't have to be a machine learning expert 
to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app.

- Easy-to-use: Focus on tasks instead of algorithms
- Visual: Built-in, streaming visualizations to explore your data
- Flexible: Supports text, images, audio, video and sensor data
- Fast and Scalable: Work with large datasets on a single machine
- Ready To Deploy: Export models to Core ML for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps

### [PyCaret](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret)

PyCaret is an open source `low-code` machine learning library in Python 
that aims to reduce the hypothesis to insights cycle time in a ML experiment. 
It enables data scientists to perform end-to-end experiments quickly and efficiently. 
In comparison with the other open source machine learning libraries, 
PyCaret is an alternate low-code library 
that can be used to perform complex machine learning tasks with only few lines of code. 
PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper 
around several machine learning libraries and frameworks 
such as `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `Microsoft LightGBM`, `spaCy` and many more.
