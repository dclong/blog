Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
Please read with your own judgement!
**

1. Empty rows are not allowed in a list in JSON.

2. No comments allowed in a JSON file.
    However, 
    you can put comments into a field.
    Another better option is to use YAML 
    or JSON5 (if you use JavaScript).

## JSON Parsing Libraries in Python

1. [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) 
    is a great JSON parsing library for Python.

2. [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson)
    is a C++ library for parsing JSON 
    which supports on-demand APIs. 
    [pysimdjson](https://github.com/TkTech/pysimdjson)
    is a Python wrapping over 
    [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson)
    .
    It is another good choice of JSON parsing library for Python.


### [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) 
[orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) 
is a fast, correct JSON library for Python. 
It benchmarks as the fastest Python library for JSON 
and is more correct than the standard json library or other third-party libraries. 
It serializes dataclass, datetime, numpy, and UUID instances natively.

### [ujson](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson)
[ujson](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson)
is an ultra fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with bindings for Python 3.6+.

### [python-rapidjson](https://github.com/python-rapidjson/python-rapidjson)
[python-rapidjson](https://github.com/python-rapidjson/python-rapidjson)
is a Python module wraps 
[rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson)
which is an extremely fast C++ JSON parser and serialization library.

### [hyperjson](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson)
[hyperjson](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson)
is a hyper-fast, safe Python module to read and write JSON data. 
Works as a drop-in replacement for Python's built-in json module. 
This is alpha software and there will be bugs, 
so maybe don't deploy to production just yet.
