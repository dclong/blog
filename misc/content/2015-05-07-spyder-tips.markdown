1. if an opened script does not automatically refresh after being modified in another place,
you can click on the editor tab at the bottom to manually refresh it.

2. the best way to run a block of code in spyder 
is to define cells using `#%%`, shift + enter.
F9 runs current line or selection 
SpyDer does not goes to the next line automatically, 
so you have to press the `Down` arrow key to go to the next line manually.

3. it seems that you cannot define shortcuts by yourself in spyder


3. you cannot run definition of a function or a if/else code block line by line 
similar to what you can do in RStudio
however, you can define cells to contain blocks of code to run.


ctrl + I gives help doc on object ... cursor has to be on a function

an open parenthesis pops up the argument hints, you can type in mutliple open parentheses ...
and you can put mouse on the pop-up to make it stay 

spyder run code not as convenient as rstudio, 
but you can use cells to help you, a little bit more work ...
shift + enter 

is it possible to customize hotkeys?
