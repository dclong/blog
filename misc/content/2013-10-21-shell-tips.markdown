**
Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. 
It is not meant to readers but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.
**

1. [explainshell.com](http://www.explainshell.com/) 
is a great place for learning shell.

## Configuration 

1. Debian does not read in the `.profile` file on start-up of X windows. 
To solve this problem, 
you can source in `.profile` in in the `.xsessionrc` file. 
Ubuntu and Mint does read in the `.profile` file on start-up of  X windows.

2. You'd better use robust configuration files.
If an error is encountered in the `.xsessionrc` file,
the desktop environment might fail to start.

## Programming

0. Dash is faster than bash and thus is often used as login shell
while bash has more features and is often used as interactive shell
`.profile` is intend to be read by shell script 
you should not use any bash specific feature in it.

1. You do not have to escape quotes in sub shells (command in `$()`).

### Media

6. empty CD tray, cannot eject by pressing the bussion, 
an interesting trick to eject CD: try to amount the CD eject the tray

## Cool Command

23. `~` is recognized as the home directory of the current user in shell only.
You'd better not use it in other places.
Whenever the home directory of the current user is needed, 
you can always use `$HOME` instead.

5. Check whether a system is 32 bit or 64 bit

```bash
getconf LONG_BIT
```

8. all parameters: `$@` (what about `$*`?)

14. advance use of `[[ ]]` wild cards ...

15. alias, function versus scripts, function is more robust, convenient, 
but you have to source them in every time, which decreases performance
you should think about things similar to python and ruby, use them in both ways!
alias similar to function,
prefer script than alias and function, generally speaking
counter example cs
Vim !: has no access to shell alias or functions 
another reason to use script
function versus script:
function need to refreshed (fun is cached)
while scripts need not after modified
so I think scripts is more suitable to use
I vote for separate fun and script

22. shell scripts are more flexible than shell functions, 
because you can use shabang, which gives flexibility to use any script language
shell function is must sometimes, e.g., cs example, shell scripts are run in sub shell
() ... $() ...
use $0 and $BASH_SOURCE to write ... your example

20. 
```bash
FILE="example.tar.gz"
echo "${FILE%%.*}"
```
example
```bash
echo "${FILE%.*}"
```
example.tar
```bash
echo "${FILE#*.}"
```
tar.gz
```bash
echo "${FILE##*.}"
```
gz
```

23. avoid using "global" bash variables in sub shell, 
many things are sub shell, very dangerous, and be careful!!!, 
duplicity, aerofs, dropbox examples ...

24. bash array index is 0-based

28. Be careful about `.` when using regular expressions (e.g., sed),
this is really a general problem


`-b file` = True if the file exists and is block special file.

`-c file` = True if the file exists and is character special file.

`-d file` = True if the file exists and is a directory.

`-e file` = True if the file exists.

`-f file` = True if the file exists and is a regular file

`-g file` = True if the file exists and the set-group-id bit is set.

`-k file` = True if the files' "sticky" bit is set.

`-L file` = True if the file exists and is a symbolic link.

`-p file` = True if the file exists and is a named pipe.

`-r file` = True if the file exists and is readable.

`-s file` = True if the file exists and its size is greater than zero.

`-s file` = True if the file exists and is a socket.

`-t fd` = True if the file descriptor is opened on a terminal.

`-u file` = True if the file exists and its set-user-id bit is set.

`-w file` = True if the file exists and is writable.

`-x file` = True if the file exists and is executable.

`-O file` = True if the file exists and is owned by the effective user id.

`-G file` = True if the file exists and is owned by the effective group id.

`file1 –nt file2` = True if file1 is newer, by modification date, than file2.

`file1 ot file2` = True if file1 is older than file2.

`file1 ef file2` = True if file1 and file2 have the same device and inode numbers.

`-z string` = True if the length of the string is 0.

`-n string` = True if the length of the string is non-zero.

`string1 = string2` = True if the strings are equal.

`string1 != string2` = True if the strings are not equal.

`!expr =` True if the expr evaluates to false.

`expr1 –a expr2` = True if both expr1 and expr2 are true.

`expr1 –o expr2` = True is either expr1 or expr2 is true.

if a function has the same name as a script, 
the function comes first,
but if you prefix it with sudo, then the script is run as a function 
is invisible in sub shells 

2. the trick of "--" end of command after which only positional arguments are accepted

3. variable substituation makes things very interesting in shell,
for example awk and so on ..., always be careful if you use "$" and so on....

4. process of substitution <() >(), pipe ...

15. variables defined in bash function won't polute the global environment
and local make the variables visible only to the scope of the function

17. prefer dot rather than source for sourcing script,
because source is only for bash

18. executable files:
if in $HOME/bin, prefer symbolic links, 
if for general uer, prefer to make a global copy,
don't use symbolic link in /usr/bin pointing to your own files,
you might change your file permissions and mess up the program

23. If an environment path contains spaces, 
you have to quote it with double/single quotations marks 
in order to make shell commands work correctly.

### Bash Programming

1. case ... esac is different from switch(){} in C/C++. 
You do not have to return/exit manually after each branch.


not condition
```bash
if [ ! -d "$1" ]; then
fi
```

### top

3.  top command 
Unit of the Time+ column: minutes:seconds.hundredths

### ls

7. `ls -d */` displays all directories in the current folder

1. `ls /home/*` in bash, don't use it, instead use `(/home/*)` directly
```bash
ls -d "/home/dclong/btsync/backup/tbp_"*
```
instead of 
```bash
ls -d "/home/dclong/btsync/backup/tbp_*"
```
it seems to me that if you wildcard, 
then full names are returned, otherwise, short names are returned.

20. By default, 
the year for files older than 6 month are not displayed. 
You can force `ls` to show full time information by `ls -lh --full-time`. 

### rsync

10. `rsync`, `/` at the end is important, 
this decides whether the folder is copy or its content is copied, unison is similar ...
This is the same for some other commands like Amazon S3, etc. 
Also if you want to exclude an folder from `rsync`,
you have to include the trailing slash.

1. 

### alias

25. it seems alias has lots of limitations ... only use single quotation mark,
causes lots of problem
YOU ACTUALLY CAN USE DOUBLE QUTOES 

1. If you define an alias of a path (especially a Windows path in Cygwin, MobaXterm, etc.), 
you have to quote the path in commands, generally speaking. 
For example, if the alias of path you define is `p` (which contains spaces),
you can use `cd "$p"` to change working directory to it. 
Note that you cannot omit the quotes.

## Filesystem

### cp

26. always use `cp` with `-i` option!

2. `cp -a` might not be a good idea sometimes, 
e.g., when in Cygwin/MobaXterm, because you might lose file permissions due to unmatch of users

1. Both cp and mv overwrite the destination file 
if is is already exists.
cp does not overwrite existing destination directory
but instead acts as merging contents of directories.
mv refuses to rename a directory to a destination directory
if the destination directory is not empty.

It is suggested that you use rsync as much as possible 
as an alternative to cp.

```bash
# copy sub files/folders excluding hidden files/folders
cp a/* b
# copy sub files/folders including hidden files/folders
cp a/. b 
```

### mv

5. always use interactive version of `mv` and `cp` ...
and always use `trash` instead of `rm`

### rm

11. 
```bash
rm ./'--exclude.!sync'
```

11. get file name without extension

```bash
basename -s .txt f.txt
```

12. Create a temp file

```bash
mktemp -tu file.XXXXX
```

12. Prefer `mktemp` to `tempfile`

### gpasswd

6. `gpasswd` is great for adding and removing user to/from groups

16. 
```bash
gpasswd -d user group
```

### type

27. `type fun_name` shows source code of bash functions or use `declare -f`
`type command` path of command

### mount

10. check if a path is a mount point
```bash
if [ $(stat -fc%t:%T "mnt/wd") != $(stat -fc%t:%T "mnt/wd/..") ]; then 
    echo "mounted"; else echo "not mounted"; 
fi
```
13. mount as normal user instead of root

```bash
mount -o uid=dclong ...
```

### sudo

8. I think it's better to use sudo inside bash script 
instead of prefix sudo to script names to invoke them.
The reason is that you use sudo only when needed.

1. sudo alias 
```bash
alias sudo='sudo ' 
```
the space is necessary

### real absolute path

19. realpath: absolute path

22. absolute path 
```bash
readlink path
```

### random

5. 
```bash
$RANDOM 0 - 32767 uniform
```

### Power Management

14. Show battery/power information 

```bash
acpi -bi
```

### Shell Programing Trick

2. generate 00, 01, ..., to 25.

```bash
for i in {00..25}; do echo $i; done
```
or
```bash
seq -f %02g 0 25
```

## Administration

3. shutdown, poweroff, halt
It seems these commands have different meanings on different Linux distributions. 
The actually case is really complicated. 
It depends on different Linux distributions and also the services running on laptops. 
If a service fails to stop, 
the shutdown process might freeze at the logo page. 
```bash
halt -p 
```
It is suggested that you always use the `poweroff` command to shutdown (and poweroff) your computer.

You should close all programs before you logout or shutdown your computer. 

7. to change time zone using command sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

25. `ssh -X` X11 forwarding, make it possible for you to use GUI applications on server

## Task

8. `at` command run in backgroud, 
so do not use it to do things that have to communicate with stdin stdout ...

## Shell Scripting

22. It is recommended that you use single quotes when defining aliases
unless you have good reasons to use double quotes.
The reason is that shell variables in aliases defined in single quotes 
are not expanded until runtime.
This makes your alias more robust (shell variables do not have to defined before aliases) 
and flexible (you can change definition of shell variables later as needed). 

6. In terminal, 
wild cards are expanded before passed to functions. 
This means that if you pass wild cards from a function to nested functions, 
it usually will not work. 
Instead, 
you should pass the whole argument list,
which is represented by `$@`.


## Archive

1. DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix 
because 7-zip does not store the owner/group of the file.

2. difference between 7za and 7z?

## UI

5. use syndaemon -dti 0.5 to disable touchpad while typing. 
You have to have `Option SHMConfig "on"` or `Option SHMConfig "true"` in the synaptics configuration file.

8. Sometimes when you login into a server, 
it freezes after printing the welcome message. 
You can press `CTRL + C` to kill running process and it might help you bring the terminal back.

9. Linux release specific information
```bash
lsb_release -a
```
the lsb-release package

## Process

1. Use `Ctrl + Z` to pause a process and use `bg` to send it to background to run. 
Use `fg` to bring a background process to foreground.

7. `ldd --version` check glibc version

3. You can use `ps aux | grep -i user_id` to list your jobs 
and `kill -9 process_id` to kill a process.
On platform Load Sharing Facility (LSF), 
you probably don't have access to `kill` unless are a privileged user.
Instead of using `ps` and `kill`, 
you can use `bjobs` to show your jobs and `bkill process_id` to kill your process.


1. when defining alias, 
do not use tailing `/` in paths unless you have a good reason for that ...

2. file to check link cannot use trailing `/`

4. what have caused the blog difference issue?, line terminators


5. comm: make sure you don't screw up by invisible white spaces!!!, 
intersection/inner join, left join, right join (add keywords to your blog)

10. type of disk

```bash
df -T
```


In a `case ... esac` clause, you have to espace spaces in matching patterns,
e.g., You should use `*Linux\ Mint*` instead of `*Linux Mint*` in the following code.

```bash
case "$dist" in
    *Debian* | *LMDE* | *Ubuntu* | *Linux\ Mint* )
        # install minimum texlive and some extra fonts
        wajig install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra dvipng texstudio
        return 0;;
    * )
        echo "This script does not support ${dist:13}."
        return 1;;
esac
```

loop throught English letters

```bash
for letter in {a..z} ; do
  echo $letter
done

for letter in {c..f} ; do
  echo $letter
done
```


1. use "#!/usr/bin/env python" instead of #!/usr/bin/python?

2. Direct output and error message

```bash
command1 > out.txt 2> err.txt
```

```bash
command2 -f -z -y > out.txt 2> err.txt
```


## Environment Variables

using envrionment variables in script that doesn't exists is really dangerous!!! 
came across this multiple times. 
how should solve the problem? 
Check whether a variable exists before you use it?

CPU Stats

## UUID in Bash
```bash
uuidgen
```
need the libuuid library which is part of `util-linux`

1. `id -un` is a better alternative than `whoami`.
