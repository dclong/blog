3. get the row where index is NaN?

4. it is strange that sometimes series of booleans cannot be used for slicing?

5. what operations cause a data frame to sort its columns and/or rows?

6. difference between merge and join?

7. it seems that DataFrame.str.replace and Series.str.replace 
use regular expression by default. 
Is there any way to perform literal string substitution
like what the `fixed=True` options does for regular expression related functions in R?
