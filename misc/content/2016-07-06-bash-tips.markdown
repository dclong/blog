Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers
but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.

1. [explainshell.com](http://www.explainshell.com/) 
    is a great place for learning shell. 

2. [Bash-it/bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it)
    is a great community driven Bash framework.

3. It is suggested that you avoid writing complicated Bash scripts. 
    [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    is a much better alternative.

4. Do NOT use `;` to delimit paths passed to a shell command because `;` terminates shell commands.
  Use `,` to delimit paths if needed.

## Redirect Output

1. Redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file.

        command > out 2> error

2. Redirect stderr to stdout (&1), and then redirect stdout to a file.

        command > out 2> &1

3. Redirect both to a file.

        command &> out
