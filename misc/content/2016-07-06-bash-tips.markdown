## Regular Expression Match

You can use `=~` for regular expression mathch in Bash.
This make Bash syntax extremely flexible and powerful.
For example, 
you can match multiple strings using regular expression.
```
if [[ value =~ ^(v1|v2|v3)$ ]]; then
    ...
fi
```

## Redirect Output

1. Redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file.

        command > out 2> error

2. Redirect stderr to stdout (&1), and then redirect stdout to a file.

        command > out 2> &1

3. Redirect both to a file.

        command &> out
