## Libraries

[mlflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)
mlflow tracks every detail about a model (including training, servering, etc.)
but it seems to be a little bit complicated to use.

[dvc](https://dvc.org/)

[DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com/)

dvc + DAGsHub sounds like a good lightweighted way to go.

[Pachyderm](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm)

Data Versioning, Data Pipelines, and Data Lineage
