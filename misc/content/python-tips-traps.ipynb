    "1. One of the trickiest problem in Python is conflicting package/module name. \n",
    "    For example, \n",
    "    if you have a Python script named `abc.py` in the current directory \n",
    "    and your script depends on the Python module `collections.abc`,\n",
    "    you code will likely fail to run. \n",
    "    Another (really tricky) eample is that if you have a Python script named `pyspark.py`\n",
    "    and submit it to  a Spark cluster to run (using `spark-submit`).\n",
    "    The PySpark application will likely throw an error saying that the `pyspark` module is not found.\n",
    "    Those are just 2 commonly seen examples. \n",
    "    You can easily run into this issue when you run ad hoc Python scripts \n",
    "    (unlikely to encounter this issue when you develop a Python package).\n",
    "    A possible way to avoid this issue is to always prefix your ad hoc Python script with a leading underscore (`_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `int` type in Python 3 is unbounded,\n",
    "    which means that there is no limit on the range of integer numbers that an `int` can represent. \n",
    "    However, \n",
    "    there are still various integer related limits in Python 3 due to the interpreter's word size (`sys.maxsize`)\n",
    "    (which is the same as the machine's word size in most cases).\n",
    "    This number is the size of the largest possible list or in-memory sequence."

    "  However, \n",
    "  this issue can come up in a few situations and can be quite tricky for uers to figure out.\n",

    "      this issue will come up.\n",
    "    b. An even trickier situation is when a Python script is piped to a Python interpreter directly. \n",
    "      According to [docs about sys.path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path),\n",
    "      `sys.path[0]` is initailized to be the empty string on the startup of Python in this situation \n",
    "      which directs Python to search modules in the current directly first.\n",
    "      Since an user can run the command in any directory, \n",
    "      it is more likely for him/her to encounter the issue of conflicting module names. \n",
    "  If a Python script is never intended to be imported as a module, \n",
    "  one way to resolove the issue is to simply remove the first element from `sys.path`.\n",
