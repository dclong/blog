Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. 
It is not meant to readers but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.
**
 
1. exceltex ... input from excel ...

2. keep each line short, being a part of sentence,
this makes it easier to modify LaTeX code

3. bibtex: never skip city for book type!!!

4. bibtex: use volume for notes/comment, if tentatively accepted, forthcoming/to appear ... and so on

5. be careful with \footnotsize and \normalsize,
they might affect spacing ....

6. \bar for single letter, \overline for multiple letters
