[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
sounds like a good one!

[ELKI](https://github.com/elki-project/elki)
sounds like a possible tool for monitoring & alerting

[Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus)
another one but doesn't seem as popular as prometheus
