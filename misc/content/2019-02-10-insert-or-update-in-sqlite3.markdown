The UPSERT clause (following PostgreSQL syntax)
is supported in SQLite 3.24.0+.
```
INSERT INTO players (
    user_name, age
) VALUES (
    'steven', 32
) ON CONFLICT (user_name) DO UPDATE
SET age=excluded.age
;
```
For older versions of SQLite3,
you can use `INSERT or REPLACE` clause together with the trick of embedded subselects 
to keep original value of fields of the existing rows.
