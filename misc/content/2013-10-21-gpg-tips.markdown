1. Symmetric encryption (using passphrase).

        :::bash
        gpg -c file

2. Decrypt a symmetric encrypted file.
    You will be prompt to enter your passphrase.

        :::bash
        gpg file.gpg

1. You can use the following command to encrypt a file as ascii armor.
```sh
gpg -a -c file
```

2. You can specified the password using the `--passphrase` option
to avoid keyboard interaction. 
You have to quote (in double/single quotation marks) the password 
if it contains white spaces.
And you when you quote the password in double/single quotation marks,
the double/single quotation marks can be escaped as usual by `\"`/`\'`.
