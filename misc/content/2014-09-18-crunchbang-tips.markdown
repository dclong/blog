1. Step by step: Configuring automatic logins

Right-click anywhere on your Crunchbang desktop and browse to the System menu. 
Click on GDM Login Set-up. 
You'll be prompted for your administration password to make these changes.
Now, when the Login Window Preferences window appears, 
click on the Security tab and select Enable automatic login. 
You need to use the drop-down box to select the user account to log in when the computer starts.
Save your settings and reboot the computer. 
It should log in automatically first time.

And that's it. 
In our next tutorial, 
we'll be looking at making applications start automatically when the Crunchbang computer starts up.

2. Private Internet Access fails to install on 64 bit version.
It is recommended that you always use 32 bit version of CrunchBang.
