## Insurance 

1. Geigo is good choice for people who do not have good driving history 
but a bad choice for people with good driving history.

Geigo charges about 18% for cancelling policy,
which is terrible!!!



## Internet Service

1. Century Link is a very bad one! 
The speed is slow. 
Service people are irresponsible.
I have problem to use SSH and NX services.

2. Time Warner is not good either but is OK. 

## Health

1. urgent care
2. ER

## Printing

1. Office 
2. Library
3. FedEx/UPS Offices

## Tax Preparation

1. H&R Block

## Chocolate

1. Shari's Berries

## Furniture

1. Birch Lane

2. Sleepy's

## Shoes

## Airlines

Delta is not good, avoid it.

AA is OK.

From Des Moines to Chicago, Southwest Airlines is good.
