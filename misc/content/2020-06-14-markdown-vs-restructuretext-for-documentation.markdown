## Choose One Against the Other 

Use RestructureText as much as possible unless for really simple situations
or in situations when Markdown is support while RestructureText is not.

## Main Advantage of RestructureText over Markdown

- more fully-featured
- much more standardized and uniform
- built-in support for extensions
