0. I forget whether antiX image is hybrid or not. Try and find this out.

1. The command line installer of antiX is not intuitive (not as good as command line installer of Debian), 
so you'd better use the graphic installer which is much easier to use.

2. To avoid configure network manually, 
you'd better install the full version of antiX.

3. antiX uses `slim` as the login manager

4. failed to install VBoxAdditions on antiX, the Linux image is too new
use an older linux image solves antiX vboxaddition problem
