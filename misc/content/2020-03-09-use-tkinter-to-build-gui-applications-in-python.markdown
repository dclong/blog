## General Tips

1. When you develop a GUI application using Tkinter in Python, 
    `root = tk.Tk()` must be the first statement after imports.

        :::python
        import tkinter as tk
        import ...
        root = tk.Tk()
        ...

2. A Button object has the option `command` to set a callback function when clicked
    while a Label object does not have this option.

        :::python
        def button_click():
            ...


        Button(root, text="Scrrenshot", command=button_click)

    Nevertheless, 
    you can bind a callback function to any widget using the method `widget_obj.bind`.

        :::python
        import tkinter as tk
        root = tk.Tk()


        def label_left_click(event):
            ...


        label = tk.Label(root, text="my label")
        label.bind("<Button-1>", label_left_click)

    A few things to keep in mind. 
    When you bind a callback function using the `command` option,
    the callback function takes no argument. 
    However, 
    when you bind a call back function using the method `widget_obj.bind`,
    the callback function takes an `Event` object as argument.

3. To make a label visible no matter there are text/image in it or not,
    you can set a border to it.

    label = tk.Label(root, bd=1)

    You can ke it even more visible by giving a sunken effect.

    label = tk.Label(root, bd=1, relief=tk.SUNKEN)

4. A Frame object has its own grid.
    This makes frames and grid the best combinations to manage the layout of your GUI application.
    You can use frames to group components.
    Inside each frame, 
    use grid to control the layout of widgets. 

5. It seems to me that you must keep a reference to a PhotoImage object
    in order to use it for a label. 
    A temporary PhotoImage object does not work.
    The image object can then be used wherever an image option is supported by some widget (e.g. labels, buttons, menus). In these cases, Tk will not keep a reference to the image. When the last Python reference to the image object is deleted, the image data is deleted as well, and Tk will display an empty box wherever the image was used.

6. There are 2 kinds of PhotoImage objects that you can use with Tkinter.
    The first is `Tkinter.PhotoImage` 
    while the second is `PIL.ImageTk.PhotoImage`.
    The latter is preferred as it is more flexible,
    supports more data format,
    and is easier to use.
    `Tkinter.PhotoImage` supports only GIF pictures 
    if you use the `file` option to load an image,
    and it seems to me that it does not accept `PIL.Image`.


### Change the Text of a Label 

After creating a Label (whose text has already been set),
there are 3 different approaches that you can change its text.

    label["text"] = "new text for the label"

    label.config(text="new text for the label")

The way is more complicated 
and it requires that the a text variable is specified 
when the label is created.

    import tkinter as tk
    var_text = tk.StringVar()
    label = Label(root, textvariable=var_text)
    label.pac()
    var_text = "new text for the label"

Notice that if you have set `textvariable`
when creating a label,
you cannot use the first 2 approaches to update its text.
Instead,
you must update the StringVar to update the text of the label.

Generally speaking, 
the 2nd way (using the method `Label.config`) is preferred.

### Change the Image of a Label

After creating a Label (whose image has already been set),
there are 2 ways you can change its image.

    label["image"] = some_photo_image_obj


    label.config(image=some_photo_image_obj)

Unlike the text of a Label object, 
there is no `imagevariable` option for a Label.

## Label 

If you donâ€™t specify a size, the label is made just large enough to hold its contents. You can also use the height and width options to explicitly set the size. If you display text in the label, these options define the size of the label in text units. If you display bitmaps or images instead, they define the size in pixels (or other screen units). See the Button description for an example how to specify the size in pixels also for text labels.

## Grid

Set minimum size of rows and columns of the grid.

    col_count, row_count = root.grid_size()
    for col in xrange(col_count):
        root.grid_columnconfigure(col, minsize=20)
    for row in xrange(row_count):
        root.grid_rowconfigure(row, minsize=20)
