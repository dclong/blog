## Some Kubernetes Distributions

Microk8s seems like a good option.

- k3s - a light-weight Kubernetes distribution ideal for edge and development - compatible with Raspberry Pi & ARM64 (Packet, AWS Graviton)

- k3d - makes k3s available on any computer where Docker is also running

- microk8s - a Kubernetes distribution, specifically for Ubuntu users.

- minikube - a popular, but heavy-weight option that creates a Linux virtual machine your computer using VirtualBox or similar

- Docker for Mac/Windows - Docker's Desktop edition has an option to run a local Kubernetes cluster

## Example

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: helloworldserivce

  selector:
    app: hello-world
  ports:
    - protocol: "TCP"
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30001
  type: LoadBalancer


---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
