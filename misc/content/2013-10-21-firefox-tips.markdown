1. In Debian, Iceweasel sometimes fail to wrap Chienes page well.
To solve the problem, you can just remove the .mozilla directory under you home directory. 
The cons is that this might remove some add-ons you installed, 
so you have to reinstall them.
This trick works for any application in Linux.

2. A Simple Way to Export all tab URLs (Without Using Extensions)

Go to Tools > Options.

In the General tab look for the Use Current Pages button in the Startup section. 
When you click on the Use Current Pages button, 
all the URLs of the pages open in different tabs 
are copied to the Home Page text box with a pipe delimiter. 
Copy the text to get all the URLs.

3. The keyboard shortcut to simulate clicking on the "Use Current Pages" button 
is Alt+T+O+C (tested in Firefox 14).

3. Do not backup firefox profile using BitTorrent Sync.

4. Firefox is very slow sometimes. Removing .Mozilla and restart helps.
Of course, you lose old profile.
