1. [Optimus](https://github.com/ironmussa/Optimus)

    Optimus is the one that is closest to what I want to achieve so far. 
    Looks promissing.

2. [Apache Griffin](https://github.com/apache/griffin)

    Apache Griffin supports data profiling but seems to be heavy and limited.

3. [deequ](https://github.com/awslabs/deequ)

4. [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)

    pandas-profiling is tool for profiling pandas DataFrames.
    One possible way to work with large data is to do simple profiling on the large DataFrame 
    and then sample a relative small data and use pandas-profiling to profile it.
