## [Cloud9](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/cloud9-tips/)

1. Looks much better Codenvy/Eclipse Che.

2. Python autocompletion works in the official online version. 
    However, debugging is supported only for Python2 currently.

## [theia](http://www.theia-ide.org/)

https://github.com/theia-ide/theia

1. Syntax highlighting and checking works well.

2. Debugging is not supported currently but under active development.

3. best to mount a directory that has mode 777

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /workdir:/home/project:cached theiaide/theia-full
```

## [CodiMD](https://hackmd-ce.herokuapp.com/)

## [Codenvy](https://codenvy.io/) / [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)

1. very slow

2. vi keybindings is stupid
