## [Cloud9](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/cloud9-tips/)

1. Looks much better Codenvy/Eclipse Che.

2. Python autocompletion does not work well for me currently.
    Not sure whether it's due old version or not ...

## [Codenvy][https://codenvy.io/] / [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)

1. very slow

2. vi keybindings is stupid

3. Scala support is not ready
