You can run the following magics in a cell to connect to Teradata from a BeakerX SQL kernel.

    :::bash
    %classpath add jar /workdir/jars/teradata/tdgssconfig.jar
    %classpath add jar /workdir/jars/teradata/terajdbc4.jar
    %defaultDatasource jdbc:teradata://your.teradata.com/USER=your_username,PASSWORD=your_password

After connecting to a Teradata server,
you can write SQL code in a cell just like in any other SQL IDE.
