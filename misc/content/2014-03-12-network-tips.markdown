## Debug Network Issues

1. Check whether you have block some services in /etc/hosts.allow or iptables, etc.

2. http://192.168.0.1/ is the router address

1. Turn off wireless router and moderm. 
Start wireless router and wait for 30 seconds,
and then start the moderm.

2. Use the same wireless network name and password 
so that your laptop and phone recognize it automatically.
This makes things much more convenient.
