1. mount volume, which user?

2. W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease: Could not execute 'apt-key' to verify signature (is gnupg installed?)
Couldn't create tempfiles for splitting up /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_xenial_InReleaseIgn:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease
works on 1 machine but not the other, a little bit strange ..., moved docker image locations ..., not sure it has anything to do with this ...

3. interaction between multiple docker contaisn (not necessarily the same image)

4. interaction between docker and host's db service?

5. is container persistent?


docker save/export?

which account is used when writing files to host?

docker: can it handle big files?

3. best practice for authentication required service in docker?
