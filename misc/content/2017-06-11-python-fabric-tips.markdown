Ansible is a better alternative to Fabric. 
It is suggested that you use Ansible instead.

1. Docstring will be displayed when you type the command `fab -l`.

2. Invoke is for local use.
    Fabric 2 will be based on invoke. 

## Issues

UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\u2018' in position 33: ordinal not in range(128)

It is suggested that minimize output to avoid this issue. 

Fabric has issues with Unicode-only characters right now. 
Supressing outputs (of shell commands) containing unicode can help avoid potential `UnicodeEncodeError`.

## Question

Is it possible to surpress logging information?
