1. `proc glm` has many adavantages over `proc reg` and `proc anova`. 
For example, 
`proc glm` supports categorical variables while `proc reg` does not.
It is suggested that that you use `poc glm` in place of `proc reg` and `proc anova`.
The only disadvantage of `proc glm` is that it is computationally heavier
compared to `proc reg` and `proc anova`,
but this is usually not a concern at all.
