**
Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers
but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.
**

1. lines use : while functions use ::

2. use relative path from the executable to implementation files!!!
```GDB
b ../../tree.cpp:31 if knot->name()=="GO:0006139"
```
3. it seems that there is a bug in GDB? 
Sometimes the results of running an executable directly and within GDB are different!
