1. KDE does not use the Win/Super key to pop up the application launcher menu by default. 
Instead, `Alt + F1` is used by default. 
Linux Mint slightly polishes KDE and allows users to bring up the application launcher menu using the Win/Super key.
If you are on other Linux distributions and do not have feature, 
you can get it enabled by installing the `ksuperkey` package.
