1. The icon of AeroFS doesn't show up in Ubuntu?

2. It seems that AeroFS is not fast?

3. Do you think it's necessary to install the server? ...
It sounds to me that AeroFS is still too young

4. aerofs doesn't work any more on 32 bit debian, I guess it's probably because of 32 bit ...

3. Can I use multiple servers pointing to Amazon S3?
