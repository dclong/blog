1. using Winston doesn't work, I'm sure the package has been installed correctly. It might related to path, what should i do?

2. svd doesn't work in juliastudio, but this sounds like a problem in julia studio, not julia, becuase in Julia this works. 

3. julia studio is currently very buggy

4. for containers, what's the difference between "()" and "{}"?

5. what's the difference between endof(string) and length(string), an example of different result?
