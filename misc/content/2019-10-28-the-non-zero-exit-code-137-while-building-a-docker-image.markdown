According to
[Container exits with non-zero exit code 137](https://success.docker.com/article/what-causes-a-container-to-exit-with-code-137),
there are 2 possible reasons that have caused this.
Since the exit code happened during the building of a Docker image,
it means that there is an out-of-meory (OOM) error happend.
You can try building your Docker image using a machine with a larger memory.

1. The container received a docker stop,
    and the application did not gracefully handle SIGTERM (kill -15) â€” whenever a SIGTERM has been issued,
    the docker daemon waits 10 seconds then issue a SIGKILL (kill -9) to guarantee the shutdown.

2. The application hit an out-of-memory (OOM) condition.
