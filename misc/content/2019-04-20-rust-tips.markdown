[Programming in Rust: the good, the bad, the ugly.](https://hackernoon.com/programming-in-rust-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-d06f8d8b7738)
summarizes good/bad/ugly things about Rust.

rustc: compiler for Rust

1. Rust uses the underscore name convention.

2. A variable is immutable by default.
    You can make it mutable using the keyword `mut`.

    let mut x = 1;

    There is also a keyword `cconst` in rust. 
    The difference between `const` and `let` is that 
    you must explicitly specify the type of the variable when defining it using `const`.
    `const` is seldom used in Rust.

3. Use `::` to access members in a module and enum object.

4. Use the keyword `use` to import a library.
    use the keyword `mod` to import local modules.

5. '&' vs `&mut`

6. `assert_eq!`


## Rust IDE

VSCode plus the Rust extenstion seems to be a good option.

IntelliJ based IDE is another good option.
