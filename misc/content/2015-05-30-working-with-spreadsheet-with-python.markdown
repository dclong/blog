[xlsxwriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter)
is a Python module for writing files in the Excel 2007+ XLSX file format.
XlsxWriter is designed only as a file writer. 
It cannot read or modify an existing Excel file.
However,
if an Excel file is created from data (understandable by Python),
you can create a new Excel file from the same data to overwrite the existing one. 
This sort of gives you a flavor of updating an existing Excel file.
