There are bascially 2 ways to share data among procedures 
and data steps in SAS.
The first way is to use datasets (or SQL table/views),
and the second way is to use global macro variables.
None of the solutions are elegant in my opinion 
as both datasets and global variables are "global",
however, 
that is you what you can do in SAS.
