## JS based Modules

### bokeh

Bokeh is a great JS-based package for visualization in Python and is also available in other programming languages. 
It is a free and opensource alternative to plotly (which is not totally free). 
Both bokeh and plotly is feature-rich. 
They supports all kinds of charts, data table and can easily build a dashboard.

### [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/user-guide/)

Plotly is great (even better than Bokeh) but unfortunately not totally free (very limited API calls per day). 

## `matplotlib` based Modules 

### matplotlib

The old default visualization package in Python.


has display issues without x server ...

### pandas

3. pandas

`pandas` integrates some visualization features based on matplotlib.
It makes things convenient if you have to work with data frame a lot.
