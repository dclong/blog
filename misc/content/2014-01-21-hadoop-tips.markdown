1. no update, have to update locally and upload to hadoop
3. by default 3 reps of each block of data, 3 reps is the best according to many discussions
4. hadoop is for large data of course
5. because of false tolorence/replication of data, you acutally use more space on Hadoop
6. master node (name node): data about data, primary and secondary master node, for reliable
7. data nodes (slave nodes), edge node, access point for the external applications, tools, and users that need to utilize the hadoop environment
11. edge nodes (gate to hadoop), name nodes, data nodes
