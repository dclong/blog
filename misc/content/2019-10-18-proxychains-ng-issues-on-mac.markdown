ProxyChains-ng does not work on macOS 
due to System Integration Protection (SIP).
There are basically 2 ways to fix/avoid it. 

1. Disable SIP (which is not recommended generally speaking).
    Please refer to
    [How to turn off System Integrity Protection on your Mac](https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos)
    for instructions.

2. Use ProxyChains/ProxyChains-ng in a Linux Docker container on Mac.
    For example, 
    [dclong/jupyterhub-ds](https://github.com/dclong/docker-jupyterhub-ds)
    is a Ubuntu-based Docker image with ProxyChains4 (i.e., ProxyChains-ng) installed.
