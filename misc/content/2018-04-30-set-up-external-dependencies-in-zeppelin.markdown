1. `%spark.dep` seems troublesome.
    What if I set interpreter dependency directly?
    And can I do it for a single notebook?
    How to do this, must-have feature ...
    user menu -> interpreter -> edit -> add dependency

2. jars for a specific notebook only? is it possible? properties for a single notebook?
