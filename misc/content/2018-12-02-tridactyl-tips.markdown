`ctrl + alt + esc`: toggle ignore on/off on Mac
`ctrl/cmd + g`: next search result
`shift + ctrl/cmd + g`: previous search result

## Tricks & Traps

1. `shift + insert` enters insert mode in Tridactyl, however `shift + insert` is also used as paste in JupyterLab terminals on Windows. 
    If you are using Tridactyl and JupyterLab together,
    `shift + insert` is passed to Tridactyl rather than acts as paste in JupyterLab terminals.
