## Selenium

Selenium is a great web automation tool!

[Here](https://hub.docker.com/u/selenium)
are official Docker images for selenium.

## [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)

## iMacros

## SikuliX 
SikuliX is able to automate anything visual 
but it is hard to scale and not reliable.
