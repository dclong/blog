There are 2 popular Python libraries 
[tomlkit](https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit)
and
[toml](https://github.com/uiri/toml)
for parsing TOML formatted files in Python.
[tomlkit](https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit)
is preferred to 
[toml](https://github.com/uiri/toml)
as it is more flexible and style-preserving.
