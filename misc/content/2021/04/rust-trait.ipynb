    "## Copy vs Clone \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone means the type can be duplicated.\n",
    "    Copy means the type can be duplicated by copying bytes.\n",
    "    This means that Copy implies Clone,\n",
    "    so when you implements Copy you should always implement Clone.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Clone` is a common trait for the ability to explicitly duplicate an object.\n",
    "    It differs from `Copy` in that `Copy` is implicit and extremely inexpensive, \n",
    "    while `Clone` is always explicit and may or may not be expensive. \n",
    "    In order to enforce these characteristics, \n",
    "    Rust does not allow you to reimplement `Copy`, \n",
    "    but you may reimplement `Clone` and run arbitrary code.\n",
    "    Since `Clone` is more general than `Copy`, \n",
    "    you can automatically make anything `Copy` be `Clone` as well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If a type does not implement the `Copy` trait,\n",
    "    it is moved when passed as a parameter. \n",
    "    This might cause issues of \"object moved\".\n",
    "    To resolve this issue, \n",
    "    you have to implement the `Copy` trait. \n",
    "    A simple way is to drive the `Copy` and `Clonable` traits\n",
    "    using `#[derive(Copy, Clone)]`.\n",
