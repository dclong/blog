Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazing fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. 
Developers can integrate any front-end framework 
that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. 
The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary 
with an API that the front-end can interact with.
