1. What is the fastest way to rename a big directory in Dropbox? Trough the website or locally? 

2. It seems that Dropbox is not smart about "renaming".

3. My suggestion is do it locally.

4. no need to log in manually.

5. how to keep file ownership and other attributes when syncing via dropbox?

6. 5. you'd better not store symbolic links in dropbox,
after sync, its type changes ... use hard link instead

7. dropbox crashes a lot in Debian Jessie, 
not sure what's going on, I think it's probably because some unstable programs you installed ...
