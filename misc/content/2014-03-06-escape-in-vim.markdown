1. CTRL + C as an alternative

2. Map CapsLock to Escape (preferred)

cons: no caps key, 
generally speaking I type lower case and then convert letters to upper case as needed 
u/U ect 

3. Swap CapsLock and Esc 
works very well until you remote to other desktops

4. Map/Swap when needed is also a good idea
