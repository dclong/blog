## Tax

When RSU shares vest, 
shares are withheld and sold to cover your tax commitment. 
The percentage withheld is dictated by your employer typically to match how your bonus are taxed. 
They deliver those instructions to us and we must comply. 
You can view this for yourself in the Release of Confirmation 
by going to "Stock Plans" >> "Holdings" and expanding the blue arrow next to the grant date. 
You'll see "View Confirmation of Release" below the grant details. 
Generally when you sell ESPP no tax is paid upon selling them. 
However, 
coming tax season we will provide you a tax form. Where you can then work with an accountant or tax advisor on how to report that.
