## Installation 

### Ubuntu

Unfortunately,
there is no apt-get installation (even no Ubuntu PPA) for Kotlin at this time.
There are basically 3 options to install Kotlin on Ubuntu.

1. Install manually.
2. Use snap app.
3. Use sdkman to install Kotlin LOCALLY.

### Mac

You can install Kotlin using Homebrew.
