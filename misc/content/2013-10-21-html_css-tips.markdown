Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. 
It is not meant to readers but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.

1. HTML is not case sensitive, 
but it's suggested that you alway use lower case for tags.

1. `<!-- ... -->` comment 

2. always use `<!DOCTYPE>`


1. code is for verbatim code while `<script> ... </script>` 
is for scripting code that will acutally run.

3. you'd better use percent for width when formating paragraphs and so on, 
this is more portable `<p style="width:79%"> ... </p>`

1. it seems that figcaption in html5 cannot align correctly, must rely on div to align, 
but only center works perfect.
