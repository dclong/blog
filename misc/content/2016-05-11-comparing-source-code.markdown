Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers
but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.
**

there are lots of existing code: colordiff/diff, vimdiff, etc.
a small tip when working with others and formatting is not consistent
对于格式问题 可以直接先删除空格等 然后再比较文件！！！very briliant idea!!! sed -i 's/ //g' *.r
