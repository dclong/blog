## ODBC

### teradata

1. `teradata` relies on either ODBC or RESTful.
    If you use teradata with ODBC,
    it is suggested that you use CentOS (docker can be leveraged) as Teradata SQL offers official RPM packages for CentOS
    but offers no official DEB package for Ubuntu.

2. It seems that Teradata ODBC 16.20 no longer requires unixODBC
    and actually it shouldn't be install in order for Teradata ODBC 16.20 to work.

### pyodbc

1. pyodbc works for Teradata too.
