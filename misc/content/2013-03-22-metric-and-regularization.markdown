## Metric/Loss Function
- 0-1 Loss (or binary loss function)

- L1 norm

- L2 norm

- Lp norm

- Any feasible metric


## Regularization/Model Selection
Regularization add a penalty term to an object function to optimize. 
The type of regularizatin depends on the penalty used not the type of the objective function. 
- Mallow's Cp
- Adjusted R^2
- AIC
- BIC 
- L1 penalty
lasso regularization
both hard and soft shrinkage (good if you can give a picture here)
- L2 penalty 
ridge regularization
soft shrinkage. 

- Linear combination of L1 and L2 penalty
elastic regularization
