### Master PDF Editor
Free for non-commerical use. 

### Wondershare PDFelement
great one, support Chinese, need to purchase a licence unfortunately



### PDFfiller 
a good one but does not support Chinese currently

### [Free PDF Convert](https://www.freepdfconvert.com/) 
great for convert PDF files to office files, etc. 
so that you can edit it. 
But unfortunately non-free 1 file per 30 minutes

### Bluebeam Revue eXtreme 
great, support Chinese, commerical, 30 days free trial

### flpsed
a good WYSIWYG PDF editor, too simple, does not support Chinese
