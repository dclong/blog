1. SikuliX is implemented in Java but binings for other programming languages are available. 
    For example,
    [sikulix4python](https://github.com/RaiMan/sikulix4python) 
    and 
    [robotframework-sikulixlibrary](https://github.com/adrian-evo/robotframework-sikulixlibrary)
    are 2 Python bidings.
    [sikulix4python](https://github.com/RaiMan/sikulix4python) 
    is inactive at this time.
