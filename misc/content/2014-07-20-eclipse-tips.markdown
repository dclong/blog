1. install MarketPlace after you install eclipse

2. To change editor fonts in Eclipse.

Menu -> Windows -> Preference -> General -> Apprearance -> Colors and Fonts -> Text Font -> Edit (on the right panel) 

3. Eclipse has an extensive amount of settings. 
Sometimes it is hard to find the right settings you want. 
A better way is to type in text in the search box to search for the settings you want.
