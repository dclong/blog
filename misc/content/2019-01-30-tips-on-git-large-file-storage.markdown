## Installation

Please refer to 
[git-lfs Installation](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation)
for instructions on how to install git-lfs.


## Tips and Traps

1. It seems to be that git-lfs automatically tracks large files now if it is installed and enabled,
    which makes things more convenient.
