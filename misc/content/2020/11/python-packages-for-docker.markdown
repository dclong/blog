## [docker-py](https://github.com/docker/docker-py)
[docker-py](https://github.com/docker/docker-py)
is a Python library for the Docker Engine API. 
It lets you do anything the docker command does, 
but from within Python apps 
â€“ run containers, manage containers, manage Swarms, etc.



## [conu](https://github.com/user-cont/conu)

[conu](https://github.com/user-cont/conu)
is a library which makes it easy to write tests for your containers 
and is handy when playing with containers inside your code. 
It defines an API to access and manipulate 
containers, images and provides more, very helpful functions.
