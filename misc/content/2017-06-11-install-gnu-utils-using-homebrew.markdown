# Configuration
Run the following command in terminal before you install any GNU utils using Homebrew.
It will ensures that the installed GNU utils get used by default.
```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/findutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/findutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
```
Notice that upgrading your Mac OS will reset the 2 environment variables.
So you will have to run the above commands again after you upgrading your Mac OS.

# GNU Core Utils
```bash
brew install coreutils
```
