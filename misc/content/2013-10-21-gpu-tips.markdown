1. CUDA and OpenCL are the 2 frameworks for GPU computing.
    CUDA is commerical and for Nvidia GPUs only 
    while OpenCL is opensource and support more GPUs.
    Generally speaking, 
    CUDA has slight better performance than OpenCL on Nvidia GPUs.
    It is suggested that you go with CUDA if you want to squeeze the most out of performance.

## [Thrust](https://developer.nvidia.com/thrust)

Thrust is a parallel algorithms library which resembles the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). 
Thrustâ€™s high-level interface greatly enhances programmer productivity 
while enabling performance portability between GPUs and multicore CPUs. 
Interoperability with established technologies (such as CUDA, TBB, and OpenMP) facilitates integration with existing software.

## [jcuda](https://github.com/jcuda/jcuda)

Java bindings for CUDA.

## [RustaCUDA](https://github.com/bheisler/RustaCUDA)

Rusty wrapper for the CUDA Driver API.

## [accel](https://github.com/rust-accel/accel)

## [emu](https://github.com/calebwin/emu)

Emu is a framework for developing safe, robust GPU-accelerated applications in Rust.
