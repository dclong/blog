**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. It is not meant to readers but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.**
 

1. Nvidia has very poor support on Linux, so avoid Nvidia graphics card and use AMD or Intel instead if you want to use Linux.

2. OpenCL has a brighter future than CUDA. not sure about MS C++ AMP ... not recommended

4. AMD APP SDK seems to be the best tool, you can use it even if no GPU 

----------------------------------------------

## good CUDA packages:
1. thrust
    - reduce
    - scan
