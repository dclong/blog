Regularization add a penalty term to the loss function in machine learning models.
The type of regularizatin depends on the type of penalty used 
(not the type of the objective function).
Below is a summary of commonly seen regularizations.

## Mallow's Cp

## Adjusted R^2

## AIC

## BIC 

## L1 Regularization

L1 both hard and soft shrinkage (good if you can give a picture here)

A regression with L1 regularization is also called LASSO regression.

## L2 Regularization 

L2 regularization results in soft shrinkage. 

Regression with L2 regularization is also called Ridge regression.

## Lp ($1 < p < 2$) Regularization

## Elastic Net Regularization

Elastic Net Regularization is a lienar combination of L1 and L2 penalty.
