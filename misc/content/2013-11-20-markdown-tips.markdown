1. There are 2 ways to include (other Markdown) files in a Markdown file. 
    The first way is to use the tool [markdown-include](https://github.com/sethen/markdown-include).
    Another way is to use the tool pandoc.
    Please see discussions on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4779582/markdown-and-including-multiple-files).
