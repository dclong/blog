**
Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes and thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers
but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.
**


1. How to reuse path? 
and is it possible to use windows environment variables in AutoHotkey scripts?

2. is it possible to specify a different script location?


2. can ahk be used with regular expression?

3. is it possible to let AutoHotkey popup a list of values to choose from like AutoKey does?
This makes things more convenient many times ...
