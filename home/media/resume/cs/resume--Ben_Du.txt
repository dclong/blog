Summary of Qualifications:
>	Motivated, Diligent and hardworking person well trained in computer science, statistics and math. 
>	Demonstrated extensive experience in algorithms, data structures, parallel computing, object-oriented programming, Linux, data mining machining learning, etc.
>	Versatile wit with exceptional knowledge in Java, C/C++, Python, Ruby, SQL, VB.net, JavaScript, etc.


Education:
>	PhD, Statistics, Iowa State University (ISU)                              Expected June 2013
>	BS, Statistics, University of Science and Technology of China                             June 2008


Projects:

Implementation of Statistical Methods in C++
>	Implemented carefully designed high performance template classes for adaptive rejection sampling; the implementation is much faster than the R package "ars" which is implemented in C.
>	Implemented template classes for sequential permutation test which takes advantage of parallel computing; developed the R package "dclong.spt" wrapping the C++ code.

Intelligent Email System
>	Developed a broad scope email-based-applications system in MS Access using VBA. 
>	Functions of the system includes: contacts database; holiday, birthday and agenda reminder; borrowing and lending system; Englis (extensible to other languages) words and phrases learning; general purpose email parser, e.g., automatically download students's homework for printing. 
>	All applications in this system are highly interactive via email.
>	The system greatly simplifies daily work and improves work efficiency. 

Java Mail APIs Wrapper for R
>	Developed the R package "dclong.jmail" wrapping Java Mail APIs; achieved good balance between usability and consistency with original API structures.
>	The package brings great convenience to R users who have to deal with emails in R. 

Learning Software for MS Office 2007 (part-time job)
>	Develop learning software for MS Office 2007 in VB.net in 2008.
>	The learning software was very helpful for people that were uncomfortable with great changes of MS Office 2007 compared to MS Office 2003. 


Teaching Experience:
>	Acted as teaching assistant and lab assistant for several graduate level courses including Statistical Methods, Advanced Probability Theory, Advanced Statistical Inference and Bayesian analysis.
>	Stimulated students's interests; cultivated and enhanced their understanding in statistical concepts.
>	Tutored a student during summer 2009 on probability theory; improved and expedited her study.

Extracurricular Activities:
>	Organized Career Day 2012 for the Dept. of Statistics and the Dept. of Math at ISU.
>	Lunched a software learning group and taught R, MATLAB and Mathematica to members.
>	Revitalized the mailing list of CSSA in Ames and maintained it for 2 years.
>	Initiated an "English Only" campaign among international students in the Dept. of Statistics at ISU.
