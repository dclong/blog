Projects:

Modeling and Inference for Equivalence Classes of 3-D Orientations 	
>	Introduced the UARS model for equivalence classes of orientations; the model has a nice geometric interpretation.
>	Proposed a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for MCMC and implemented it in parallel MATLAB code.
>	Demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian method beats standard likelihood-based approaches.

Clustering Equivalence Classes of 3-D Orientations
>	Proposed a hierarchical method for clustering orientations with spatial information; the method has several "knobs" for tuning clusters.
>	Originated a series of Markov chains on partitions (named Du Process); proved properties of the Du process; illustrated use of the Du Process in model-based Bayesian clustering.

Salmonella Shedding Phenotypic Classes Prediction
>	Examined data quality with the R package "arrayQualityMetrics"; uncovered and dropped a problematic chip.
>	Invented non-statistical methods to filter genes/variables/features; alleviated the problem of large number of variables (genes) and small number of observations (samples).
>	Integrated the lasso method with the logistic regression model to further select genes; identified a small list of biologically interesting genes which is under investigation using qPCR technology. 

Miscellaneous Statistical Genetics Projects involving Affymetrix Genechip and RNA-seq data
>	Communicated with non-statisticians, learned their problems, understood their intensions and explained statistical concepts and analysis results to them.
>	Analyzed data using generalized/mixed linear models; adapted methods and solved problems of low expression, dependency structure, heterogeneous variance, confound factors and numerical issues.


Teaching Experience:
>	Acted as teaching assistant and lab assistant for several graduate level courses including Statistical Methods, Advanced Probability Theory, Advanced Statistical Inference and Bayesian analysis.
>	Stimulated students's interests; cultivated and enhanced their understanding in statistical concepts.
>	Tutored a student during summer 2009 on probability theory; improved and expedited her study.
